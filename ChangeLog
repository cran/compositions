Version 2.0-5
   * Adapted to new rgl 1.0.1 interface
	

Version 2.0-4
   * F77_ calling conventions adapted from fixed length strings to length parameter in BLAS calls
   * fitDirichlet returned loglikehood fixed (by adding a "-" in front of n)
   * as.matrix.rmult method returns now a matrix with the rmult class stripped; in this way, derivate functions of `lm()` work properly (e.g. `anova`, `summary.manova`, `MASS::lda`)
	

Version 2.0-3
  * kernel density estimation on the simplex with Dirichlet kernels (kdeDirichlet)

Version 2.0-2.9000
  * own implementation of dDirichlet

Version 2.0.2 and Version 2.0-1.9001

Minor changes / Bugfixes:
  * functions that do not work with sticky classes are now wrapped 
  (e.g. `anova()`)


Version 2.0-1.9000

Major change: sticky classes! 
  * Now objects of compositional classes do not miss their class 
  when subsetting. For example, if `x` is an "acomp" object,
  x[1:2,] will also be an "acomp" object. Selection of columns work 
  as well, but it is a bit more tricky. Check ?`[.acomp` for
  details. You can get this behaviour skipped by setting
  setStickyClassOption(FALSE). 
  * The dollar notation `$` also works for subsetting columns.

Added:
  * Limited support for using compositions classes as formal S4 
  classes, for instance in slots of S4 classes expecting a 
  "data.frame" or a "structure" (matrix or array).
  * self-invertibility: now "rmult" objects created by any 
  transformation (cdt, clr, cpt, idt, ilr, ipt, iit, ilt, alr,
  apt) remember the original data and the transformation between
  them, and can be back-transformed with `backtransform`.
  * added cdt and idt methods for objects of class "factor" (returning
  the contrasts and their ipt transformation), and for "data.frame"
  objects (exploiting the attribute "origClass" if they have it).
  * `pwlr()`: pairwise logratio transformation (and inverse: `pwlrInv()`)
  * `pwlrPlot()`: pairwise logratio plots vs covariables, both as explained 
   and as explanatory variables. This makes use of the ability of plot(x~y)
  to react to the nature of `x` and `y` to create scatterplots, boxplots
  and spineplots.
  * transformation functions between variation and clrvar: variation2clrvar
  and clrvar2variation
  * `split()` methods for compositional classes
  * new panels for filling `pairs()` plots with boxplots, densities, 
  kde2d-densities, etc...: check ?vp.kde2dplot
  
Minor Changes:
  * the function to fit linear models of coregionalisation is now called
  `fit.lmc()`; use full name specification with it! `compositions::fit.lmc()`
  
Bugfixes:
  * bug in subsetting of one-column rmult object corected
  


-----------------------------------------
Version 0.92-1 (R (>= 2.2.0), rgl, tensorA, robustBase)

Added:	Robustness: see robustnessInCompositions (robust= parameter)
	Outlier classification: see outliersInCompositions 
	advanced treatment of Missings: see missigsInCompositions
	CodaDendrogram (Tolosana)
	A replot functionallity, changing plot parameters on the fly
	A onlyPanel Parameter to zoom individual panels of highdimensional
	 plots
	ternaryAxis
	A new coordinate subsystem
	
Changed:
	*.row *.col and *.inv replaces by *Row, *Col, *Inv to
	ensure compatibility wiht R>=2.7
	added NAMESPACE: most gsi. functions are now hidden.
	If you need them use attach(gsi) 
	
Bugfixes: "s" and "m" warnings 
	  wrong axis-labels in logarithmic pairs plots fixed
	  log option in boxplot.rplus now shows really logodds rather than
	  log relative portions.
	  Labeling in plots, missing treatment in plots.
